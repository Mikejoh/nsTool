nsTool:
------

This is a small GUI-based DNS checking tool made in Python with the help of wx and dnspython modules.

With this tool you can check the following RR-types:

A
CNAME
MX
NS
PTR

Note:
-----

Made this as a just-for-fun project when exploring and learning Python (as i still do) and why not
try out Github at the same time.

I'm happily listening to any ideas/suggestions/changes/tips or whatever! :)
